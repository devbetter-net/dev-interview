### What are the different language present in DBMS ? 
The four type of DBMS languages
1. **DML** - Data Manipulation Language: INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE
2. **DDL** - Data Definition Language: CREATE, DROP, RENAME, ALTER
3. **DCL** - Data Control Language: GRANT, REVOKE

### What are ACID properties ?
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

### What is normalization ? Explain the different types of normal forms
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The main goals of normalization are to eliminate redundant data and ensure data dependencies make sense. This is achieved through a series of rules called normal forms, which include:

1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensures that the values in each column of a table are atomic (indivisible).
2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Ensures that the table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Ensures that the table is in 2NF and all the attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key.
3. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: A stronger version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
Fourth Normal Form (4NF) deals with multi-valued dependencies. A table is in 4NF if it meets the following criteria:

1. **It is in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**.
2. **No multi-valued dependencies**: A table should not have more than one multi-valued dependency.

A multi-valued dependency occurs when one attribute in a table uniquely determines another attribute, but not vice versa. To achieve 4NF, you decompose the table to eliminate these dependencies.

#### Example

Consider a table with `StudentID`, `Course`, and `Hobby`. If a student can have multiple courses and multiple hobbies, this creates a multi-valued dependency. To normalize to 4NF, you would decompose it into two tables:

1. A table with `StudentID` and `Course`.
2. A table with `StudentID` and `Hobby`.

### Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

Fifth Normal Form (5NF), also known as Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF), deals with join dependencies. A table is in 5NF if it meets the following criteria:

1. **It is in Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**.
2. **No join dependencies**: A table should not have any join dependency that is not implied by the candidate keys.

A join dependency occurs when a table can be decomposed into multiple tables and then joined back together without losing any information. To achieve 5NF, you decompose the table to eliminate these dependencies.

#### Example

Consider a table with `ProjectID`, `EmployeeID`, and `TaskID`. If the relationship between these attributes is such that each project can have multiple employees and tasks, and each employee can work on multiple tasks, this creates a join dependency. To normalize to 5NF, you would decompose it into three tables:

1. A table with `ProjectID` and `EmployeeID`.
2. A table with `ProjectID` and `TaskID`.
3. A table with `EmployeeID` and `TaskID`.

By decomposing the table, you ensure that there are no join dependencies, thus satisfying 5NF.

### Benefits of Normalization in a Database

Normalization offers several benefits, including:

1. **Reduced Data Redundancy**: By organizing data into tables and eliminating duplicate data, normalization reduces redundancy and ensures that each piece of data is stored only once.

2. **Improved Data Integrity**: Normalization ensures that data dependencies make sense, which helps maintain the accuracy and consistency of the data.

3. **Efficient Data Retrieval**: With a well-structured database, queries can be executed more efficiently, leading to faster data retrieval.

4. **Easier Maintenance**: A normalized database is easier to maintain and update, as changes to data are made in a single place, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

5. **Better Data Organization**: Normalization helps in organizing data logically, making it easier to understand and manage.

6. **Enhanced Scalability**: A normalized database can handle growth more effectively, as it is designed to accommodate changes without significant restructuring.

7. **Reduced Anomalies**: Normalization minimizes insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, ensuring that the database remains consistent and reliable.


### What is Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)?

Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is an advanced version of the Third Normal Form (3NF). It is used to address certain types of anomalies that 3NF does not handle. A table is in BCNF if it meets the following criteria:

1. **It is in 3NF**: The table must already be in Third Normal Form.
2. **Every determinant is a candidate key**: For every functional dependency (X â†’ Y), X must be a super key.

In simpler terms, BCNF ensures that there are no non-trivial functional dependencies of attributes on something other than a super key. This helps in eliminating redundancy and potential anomalies in the database.

#### Example

Consider a table with the following columns: `StudentID`, `CourseID`, `InstructorID`, and `InstructorName`. If `InstructorID` determines `InstructorName`, but `InstructorID` is not a candidate key, the table would not be in BCNF. To convert it to BCNF, you would need to decompose the table into two tables:

1. A table with `InstructorID` and `InstructorName`.
2. A table with `StudentID`, `CourseID`, and `InstructorID`.

This decomposition ensures that every determinant is a candidate key, thus satisfying BCNF.


### What is an ER Diagram?

An Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram is a visual representation of the data and the relationships between entities in a database. It is used in database design to illustrate the structure of the database, including the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

#### Key Components of an ER Diagram:

1. **Entities**: Objects or concepts that can have data stored about them. Entities are usually represented by rectangles. Examples include `Student`, `Course`, and `Instructor`.

2. **Attributes**: Properties or characteristics of an entity. Attributes are usually represented by ovals connected to their respective entity. Examples include `StudentID`, `Name`, and `DateOfBirth`.

3. **Relationships**: Associations between entities. Relationships are usually represented by diamonds or lines connecting entities. Examples include `Enrolls`, `Teaches`, and `Advises`.

4. **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for an entity. It is usually underlined in the ER diagram. For example, `StudentID` can be the primary key for the `Student` entity.

5. **Foreign Key**: An attribute that creates a link between two entities. It is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables.

#### Example

Consider a simple ER diagram for a university database:

- **Entities**: `Student`, `Course`, `Instructor`
- **Attributes**:
  - `Student`: `StudentID`, `Name`, `DateOfBirth`
  - `Course`: `CourseID`, `CourseName`, `Credits`
  - `Instructor`: `InstructorID`, `InstructorName`, `Department`
- **Relationships**:
  - `Enrolls`: Between `Student` and `Course`
  - `Teaches`: Between `Instructor` and `Course`

This ER diagram helps in understanding how data is structured and related in the database, making it easier to design and implement the database schema.

### Types of JOINS in SQL

SQL provides several types of JOIN operations to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The main types of JOINS are:

1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
   ```sql
   SELECT columns
   FROM table1
   INNER JOIN table2
   ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
   ```

2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
   ```sql
   SELECT columns
   FROM table1
   LEFT JOIN table2
   ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
   ```

3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
   ```sql
   SELECT columns
   FROM table1
   RIGHT JOIN table2
   ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
   ```

4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side that does not have a match.
   ```sql
   SELECT columns
   FROM table1
   FULL JOIN table2
   ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
   ```

5. **CROSS JOIN**: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., it returns all possible combinations of rows from the tables.
   ```sql
   SELECT columns
   FROM table1
   CROSS JOIN table2;
   ```

6. **SELF JOIN**: A regular join but the table is joined with itself.
   ```sql
   SELECT a.columns, b.columns
   FROM table a, table b
   WHERE condition;
   ```

These JOIN operations allow you to retrieve and combine data from multiple tables in various ways, depending on the relationships and requirements of your query.
